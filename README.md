# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm **Gonzalo Sánchez Terrones**, a DevOps engineer with a career that started in traditional SysAdmin roles and evolved into cloud-native automation and modern infrastructure.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Background

Since 2017, I've specialized in building and operating scalable, resilient platforms. My day-to-day work revolves around **AWS ☁️, Terraform 🌍, ArgoCD 🔄, Helm ⛵, and Kubernetes 🐳**, and I’m deeply familiar with CI/CD and modern ops.  
I also have significant experience with **GitHub Actions ⚡, Python 🐍, shell scripting 💻, Kafka 🦒, SaltStack 🧂, and Datadog 📊**.

At my current company, I led the transformation from a monolithic, on-premise system to a cloud-based, highly available, auto-scalable platform on AWS. We now leverage microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes.

A key part of my role is empowering developer teams: I design policies and configure tools to enable teams to autonomously create and maintain infrastructure components tailored to their applications.

Additionally, I'm passionate about exploring AI tools to optimize workflows and drive innovation in automation and operations.

## 🏆 Certifications

Most of my expertise has been acquired through hands-on experience and continuous self-learning. I also hold the **LPI-2 certification**.
