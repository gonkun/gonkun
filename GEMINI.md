# Directory Overview

This directory contains the source code for a personal documentation website built with MkDocs. The website, titled "Gon Docs," serves as a personal knowledge base for Gonzalo SÃ¡nchez Terrones, a DevOps engineer. It contains notes, commands, and explanations related to various tools and technologies he uses in his work.

# Key Files

*   `mkdocs.yml`: The main configuration file for the MkDocs website. It defines the site's structure, navigation, and theme.
*   `docs/`: This directory contains the Markdown files that make up the content of the website. Each file corresponds to a page on the site.
*   `site/`: This directory contains the static HTML files generated by MkDocs. This is the actual website that gets deployed.
*   `README.md`: The main README file for the project, which also serves as the author's professional bio.

# Usage

This directory is used to maintain a personal documentation website. The typical workflow is:

1.  **Edit content:** Modify the Markdown files in the `docs/` directory to add or update content.
2.  **Build the site:** Run `mkdocs build` to generate the static HTML files in the `site/` directory.
3.  **Serve locally:** Run `mkdocs serve` to view the website locally and check for changes.
4.  **Deploy:** The contents of the `site/` directory are deployed to a web server (likely GitHub Pages, given the `site_url` in `mkdocs.yml`).
